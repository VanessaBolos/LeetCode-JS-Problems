# LEETCODE PROBLEM #912. SORT AN ARRAY
## Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
## Solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
### Example 1 input: nums = [5,2,3,1] 
### Example 2 input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]

## Challenges:
I was confused on how to input the arrays at first in the code but realized it is already given as a parameter as a starting point.

## How I approached the solution and any optimizations I made.
