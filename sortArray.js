// LEETCODE PROBLEM 912. SORT AN ARRAY
// Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
// You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
// Output: [1,2,3,5]
// Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
// Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
// Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
 
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
// -5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104


// Solved by mergeSort method with time complexity of O(nlog(n)) since we are combining both dividing (O(logn)) and merging (O(n))
